# Chess
Two player chess game played in the console

To run: download the chess.cpp file and run in your console using a c++ compiler of your choice!

To play: The chess pieces on the board are labeled as 3 characters, the first being the color of the piece, the second being the type of piece, and the third being an identifier of which piece in the case there are multiple on the board (ex. WB2 would be white bishop #2). Enter the piece name and the move on the board using the rank and file (ex. WP1 A4). To castle, input the move as the king moving to the correct spot. The program will see that you are requesting the king to move two spots and castle (if a legal move). En passant takes with pawns work similarly; input as the pawn moving to the spot it would end up, and the foe's pawn will be removed (if it is a legal move to do).
